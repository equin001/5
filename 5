<h1>€ddie$</h1>
<h3>Opt | In</h3>
<b>You can only opt-in to someone's €ddie$ if you meet them or whoever rightfully received their €ddie$ in person or if it's a business you trust.<b>

<h3>Id | Idea</h3>
<b>Best practice is to let someone id themselves before you opt-in to their €ddie$. <b>

<h3>Bank | transfer</h3>
<b>It's also adviced to let someone make a bank transfer to you, to add another layer to their id.<b>

<h3>Judge</h3>
<b>Not everyone has a id or bank account, so be cautious and use others or your own judgement to proceed.<b>

<h3>Incentive</h3>
<b>If you weed out people who doublespend, scam, steal or have a bad reputation, that contribute to your own rep. Every feedback must be presented with proof of facts, costing 1 €ddie$ per proof. €ddie$ can also be loaned to proof a fact.<b>
